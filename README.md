## Progress Updates

### 2022-06-15 -- Resolved vertical line artifacts

A longer description of the fix is included in the commit message. This commit marks the
completion of the "MVP" portion of the project. I think at this point the project is
probably in a "submittable" state and would receive a good grade.

### 2022-06-14 -- Added full Cornell Box Scene

Added the full Cornell Box scene geometry based on the specification from their website.
There is still a persisting bug where the renderer produces "vertical line" artifacts
(look closely at the green wall). The boxes themselves also aren't completely
perpendicular to the floor so there is some weird shading on the front of the taller box
